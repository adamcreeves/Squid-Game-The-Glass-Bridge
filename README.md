# SQUID GAME: The Glass Bridge

#### Built by Adam Reeves

### Link to play: https://glassgamebyadamreeves.com

#### I built a recreation of the glass bridge game from the Netflix show Squid Game using React JS. I used Firebase for hosting and a player database for tracking stats with Firestore.

#### There are three levels of difficulty: Easy, Medium, and Hard.

#### You can pick from 9 different characters from the TV show.

#### Can you beat my Squid Game on Hard?
